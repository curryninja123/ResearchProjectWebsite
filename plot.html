                “If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake. That will be his punishment — as well as the prison.” ― Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov

                Dostoevsky follows the dramatic structure fairly closely. Each of the six parts is well defined in  the overall arc of Crime and Punishment. The exposition is done over the first section of the novel and features Raskolnikov's thoughts and interactions rather than direct descriptions of the setting. The introduction to the climax and rising action covers most of the novel and creates the buildup to the climax. Dostoevsky heavily features both flashbacks and dream sequences to aid the buildup. The climax itself is quite a twist, and the pace of the novel reaches its maximum. The falling action follows the classic model, creating suspense before the ending. The denouement, the epilogue in this case, leaves the characters with a (somewhat) happy ending.

                          Dostoevsky introduces the setting and status quo. It is set in St. Petersburg in the mid 1800s. The main character, Raskolnikov is a young student who is struggling to make ends meet, and has come up with a very disturbing plan. In the city, there is a drunkard who has married a noble widow, and his daughter, Sonya, became a prostitute to support the family. Raskolnikov himself has a sister, Dunya, and a mother, as well as a best friend, Razumikhin, from university. From the start, we meet varied and interesting characters, and witness the set-up for Raskolnikov’s crime.

                          Raskolnikov’s plan is plagued with doubt. He wants to eliminate his debt to an old pawnbroker by killing her, and justifies it by arguing that her death will help the world. While he has moral doubts, he is driven by various occurrences around him, including a letter from his mother about his sister’s engagement to a wealthy man. His crime is well planned, but the execution is marred by his unwillingness to carry it out. In the end, he suffers from immense guilt and stress.

                          Raskolnikov lapses in and out of insanity, and his friends and family visit him to care for him. He witnesses the death of the drunkard and befriends his family. Raskolnikov finds himself fending off both his sister’s persistent fiancé, Luzhin, and the suspicious detectives. He manages to get rid of the suitor, and the investigators accuse another man of the crime. However, one of the suitor’s relatives, Svidrigailov, declares his intention to court Dunya.

                          Pressured by society, Raskolnikov suffers heavily. Nearly confessing to his crimes multiple times, he eventually confesses to the prostitute daughter of the drunkard. She convinces him to atone for his sins by publicly confessing. However, this is overheard by Svidrigailov, who intends to blackmail Dunya. He informs Raskolnikov, and approaches Dunya, but is eventually put off by her dislike for him. He leaves his money behind and secretly kills himself.
