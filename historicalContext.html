            <h3> Alexander II </h3>
            <p class = "maintext">
              During the miraculous years, in which Crime and Punishment was written, Alexander II was the ruling Emperor of Russia. He was a great reformer, the likes of which have not been seen since the rule of Peter the Great. One of his greatest accomplishments was the Emancipation of the Serfs, in which serfdom was officially abolished and all of the serfs (about 23 million) were given the full rights of citizens. It was under his rule that Dostoevsky was freed from his military service (a punishment for participating in anti-government activity) and was slowly given back his rights, including the right to publish. Eventually, under strict surveillance, Dostoevsky was allowed to return to the capital of St. Petersburg. Thus begun his six miraculous years.
            </p>
            <h3>The Miraculous Years</h3>
            <p class = "maintext">
              Between the years 1865 and 1871, Dostoevsky published two of his greatest novellas, The Gambler and The Eternal Husband and three of his greatest novels, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, and The Devils. In these short years, he found great inspiration in the circumstances with the time while simultaneously struggling with them. From his fight against his epileptic attacks to his constant evasion of pursuing creditors, Dostoevsky had only his writing as a possible source of income. Most of his writing in this time period, however, featured the unfolding ideological struggle in Russia. He believed that Nihilism, a rising ideology, was a kind of Western import that poisoned Russia, and that the traditional ideals of Russian Christianity could save his nation.
