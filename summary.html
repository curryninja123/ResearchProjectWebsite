                <p class = "maintext">
                  <i> Crime and Punishment</i> by Fyodor Dostoevsky is a novel
                  written in the 1860s and set in what was then present-day Russia.
                  The novel follow the story of a young, idealistic an, Rodion
                  Raskolnikov, who commits a murder in the hopes of improving society.
                  This idea that certain  individuals have the right to commit
                  evil for the overall betterment of society is a recurring theme
                  throughout the plot. As the story progresses, Raskolnikov meets
                  various different characters, including the detective Porfiry,
                  the chaste prostitute Sonya, and the evil yet generous Svidrigalov,
                  all the while becoming more insecure and guilty about the crime
                  he committed. Ultimately, Raskolnikov confesses to his crime and
                  the story reaches a definitive resolution in which honesty, duty,
                  and practicality triumph over evil performed with idealistic intent.

                <h4 align = "center">About this Website</h4>
                <p class = "maintext">
                  This website was put together after compiling information from
                  several <a href ="sourcesCited.html">sources</a>, including Gale,
                  Ebsco, and ABC Clio. The features of this website include an interactive
                  timeline that detail the state of Russian Society and Dostoevsky
                  during the time of the novel's conception. This, along with more
                  information about the Historical context of the novel can be found
                  <a href="historicalContext.html">here</a>. Another section of this
                  website is an in-depth <a href="plot.html">plot summary</a>
                  of the novel, much more in-depth than the one to the right.
                  Last, but certainly not least, a <a href="litCrit.html">literary
                  analysis</a> page has been created after applying conventional
                  techniques to the plot summary.
